//1095: FIND IN MOUNTAIN ARRAY
//(This problem is an interactive problem.)

//You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

//arr.length >= 3
//There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
//arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
//arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
//Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1.

//You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:

//MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
//MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.
//Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
